\title{Reweight a Seed Table to Marginal Controls}
\usage{
ipf(seed, weight_var = NULL, marginals, relative_gap = 0.01,
  max_iterations = 50, min_weight = 1e-04, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{seed}{a \code{data.frame} including necessary colums for matching to 
marginals and an optional weight field.}

\item{weight_var}{existing weights column in seed table. 
If \code{NULL}, defaults to 1.}

\item{marginals}{a two-column \code{data.frame}.  Column names must be 
\code{marginal} and \code{value}.  The \code{marginal} column is filled  
with combinations of marginal names and category numbers (e.g. "persons1",
or "wrk2").

The character portion (\code{persons} or \code{wrk}) must 
correspond to a column name in the \code{seed} table.

The numeric portion must correspond to the values found in the column of
the \code{seed} table.}

\item{relative_gap}{defines convergence.  If if no cells are factored by more 
than this amount, the process is said to have converged.  For example, the
default value of .01 imlies that convergence is reached when no cell in 
seed table is changed by more than 10 percent.}

\item{max_iterations}{maximimum number of iterations to perform, even if 
convergence is not reached.}

\item{min_weight}{Minimum weight to allow in any cell to prevent zero weights.
Set to .0001 by default.  Should be arbitrarily small compared to your 
seed table weights.}

\item{verbose}{Print details on the maximum expansion factor with each 
iteration? Default \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
a vector of weights for each row in \code{seed}
}
