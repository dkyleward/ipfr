\usage{
ipu(primary_seed, primary_targets, secondary_seed = NULL,
  secondary_targets = NULL, relative_gap = 0.01, max_iterations = 100,
  absolute_diff = 10, min_weight = 1e-04, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{primary_seed}{In population synthesis or household survey expansion, 
this would be the household seed table (each record would represent a 
household). It could also be a trip table, where each row represents an 
origin-destination pair. Must contain a \code{pid} ("primary ID") field
that is unique for each row. Must also contain a geography field that
starts with "geo_".}

\item{primary_targets}{A \code{named list} of data frames.  Each name in the 
list defines a marginal dimension and must match a column from the 
\code{primary_seed} table. The data frame associated with each named list
element must contain a geography field (starts with "geo_"). Each row in
the target table defines a new geography (these could be TAZs, tracts,
clusters, etc.). The other column names define the marginal categories that
targets are provided for. The vignette provides more detail.}

\item{secondary_seed}{Most commonly, if the primary_seed describes households, the 
secondary seed table would describe a unique person with each row. Must
also contain the \code{pid} column that links each person to their 
respective household in \code{primary_seed}. Must not contain any geography
fields (starting with "geo_").}

\item{secondary_targets}{Same format as \code{primary_targets}, but they constrain 
the \code{secondary_seed} table.}

\item{relative_gap}{After each iteration, the weights are compared to the
previous weights and the %RMSE is calculated. If the %RMSE is less than
the \code{relative_gap} threshold, then the process terminates.}

\item{max_iterations}{maximimum number of iterations to perform, even if 
\code{relative_gap} is not reached.}

\item{absolute_diff}{Upon completion, the \code{ipu()} function will report
the worst-performing marginal category and geography based on the percent
difference from the target. \code{absolute_diff} is a threshold below which
percent differences don't matter.

For example, if if a target value was 2, and the expanded weights equaled
1, that's a 100% difference, but is not important because the absolute value
is only 1.

Defaults to 10.}

\item{min_weight}{Minimum weight to allow in any cell to prevent zero weights.
Set to .0001 by default.  Should be arbitrarily small compared to your 
seed table weights.}

\item{verbose}{Print details on the maximum expansion factor with each 
iteration? Default \code{FALSE}.}

\value{
the \code{primary_seed} with a revised weight column.

\description{
A special case of iterative proportional fitting. It can satisfy
  two, disparate sets of marginals that do not agree on a single total. A
  common example is balancing population data using household- and person-level
  marginal controls. This could be for survey expansion or synthetic
  population creation. The second set of marginal/seed data is optional, meaning
  it can also be used for more basic IPF tasks.
